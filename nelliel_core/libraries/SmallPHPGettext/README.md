# SmallPHPGettext

A small library written in PHP to handle gettext functions. Done as a combination learning experience and because a lightweight gettext that could use .po files and be more flexible switching languages and domains was needed for a thing.

Requires PHP 7.0+
Uses .po files for input. Support for .mo files might be added later.
