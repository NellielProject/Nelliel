# Markup

Nelliel provides options for text formatting and markup in posts. The available markup can be customized and allows both BBCode and Markdown style options.

## Types

These are the markup types available through the markup interface:
 - **Simple:** Basic inline tags such as those used for bold or underline text.
 - **Line:** Markup applied only to a full line.
 - **Block:** Parsed in multi-line blocks. Excludes other markup inside the block.
 - **Loop:** Applied in a loop. Used for nested or multi-stage markup.

The following are special cases due to their complexity and cannot be customized through the normal interface:
 - **URL:** Links to other pages, sites or services.
 - **Cites:** Refrences to other posts or boards.
