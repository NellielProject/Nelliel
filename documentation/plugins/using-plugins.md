# Installing and Using Plugins
Instructions for using plugins with Nelliel. For reference on writing plugins see [plugin-api.md](plugin-api.md).

## Installing
Plugins will be contained within their own folder. To install:
 - Place the plugin folder in the `plugins` directory within the main directory.
 - If the plugin provides any pre-installation instructions, complete those now.
 - Go to the `Plugins` control panel and look for the plugin on the list of uninstalled plugins.
 - Select the install option. The plugin should now show up on the list of installed plugins.

## Uninstalling
Plugins can be uninstalled. This will remove plugin settings and information. If you only need to deactivate it temporarily, disable the plugin instead.

To uninstall:
 - Go to the `Plugins` control panel and look for the plugin on the list of installed plugins.
 - Select the uninstall option. The plugin should now show up on the list of uninstalled plugins.
 - Optionally remove the plugin's files from the `plugins` directory.

## Enable and Disable
Plugins can be enabled or disabled after installation. Doing so will simply activate or deactivate the plugin while leaving it installed with all settings and information intact.

To enable or disable:
 - Go to the `Plugins` control panel and look for the plugin in the list of installed plugins.
 - Select the enable or disable option.
