# Banners
Banners are images which can be displayed at the top and/or bottom of public pages. Banners can be provided for site pages or specific boards. There is currently no web interface for managing banners.

## Uploading
To add site banners, put the files in `public/assets/banners/site`.

To add board banners, put the files in `public/assets/banners/<board uri>`.
