# Domains
Nelliel uses domains to define the functional scopes of the site. Each domain has its own set of permissions. It is possible for additional domains to be defined by plugins.

## List of domains
By default there are 3 core domains:

 - **Site:** The primary site-level functions.
 - **Board:** Eash individual board and its functions.
 - **Global:** A special use case which encompasses all boards as a whole.
